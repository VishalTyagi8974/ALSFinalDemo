                    question: "Who needs to file GST returns?",
                    answer: "All businesses registered under GST, including regular taxpayers, composition dealers, e-commerce operators, and non-resident taxable persons, must file GST returns as per their category."
                },

                {
                    question: "What is the due date for filing GST returns?",
                    answer: "Due dates vary by return type. For example, GSTR-1 is due monthly or quarterly, GSTR-3B is due monthly, and GSTR-9 is due annually. It's important to check the official GST calendar for exact dates."
                },
                {
                    question: "What happens if I miss the GST return due date?",
                    answer: "Late filing of GST returns may result in a late fee, interest on the tax amount, and a restriction on generating e-way bills. Continuous non-filing may lead to cancellation of GST registration."

                {
                    question: "Can I revise a GST return after filing?",
                    answer: "GST returns cannot be revised once filed. However, any mistakes or omissions can be corrected in the return of a subsequent month or period."
